This is an example of real data as output by the program, the results of many of these tests optimized our phase setting;
  The overall result was a cleaner and tighter beam, with quantifiable improvements over where we were running before.
  This program also gave us the ability to compare real data with simulations. 
  
These benefits were made while at the same time saving dozens of man-hours that would have been required to take a similar
data set or to even take a reduced data set that showed the same results. While also being more precise than human measurements.
