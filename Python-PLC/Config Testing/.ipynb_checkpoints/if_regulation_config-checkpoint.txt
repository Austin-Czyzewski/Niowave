Parameter descriptions:
Current Tunnel: The name of the tunnel (West, Test, East)
PLC IP: The IP address of the PLC controlling the magnets. Can be found in productivity suite at the bottom of the screen.
IF_Channel: This is the oscilloscope channel that the IF error signal is being sent to
Trigger_Channel: This is the channel to trigger off of on the oscilloscope
Trigger_Level: This is the level, in Volts, that the trigger is set to
Read_Start_Voltage: This should almost always remain true. This is to test the form of the output from the oscilloscope.
                    The form of the output changes based on nuanced features in the oscilloscope and it is easier to work
                    around it than it is to change it or inform the operator how to change it.
Measurement: This is the measurement number for the average of the oscilloscope. As a reminder. It is necessary to have 
                a measurement that reads the mean value of the IF channel. This is the corresponding number of that measurement.
                As a side note, the measurement number starts at 1. So the top measurement is 1, then 2,3,4.
Step_size: This is the step size, in Hz, during CW operation
Pulse_Step_Size: This is the step size, in Hz, while pulsing.
Max_Threshold: This is the total drift level before the program stops regulation. This is in place as a precursor warning to excessive
                coupler heating but has since inception been deemed unimportant. The feature remains in case this changes.
Walk_Threshold: This is the variation, in mV, when CW, before the signal is changed on the signal generator. This is essentailly
                    the plus-minus on the 0 level for the signal.
Pulse_Walk_Threshold: This is the variation, in mV, when pulsing, before the signal is changed on the signal generator. This is essentailly
                    the plus-minus on the 0 level for the signal.
Wait_after_step: This time, in seconds, is a time set to wait after a step has been taken for the system to stabilize.
Wait_between_reads: This time, in seconds, simply slows the script down.
Interlock_Threshold_mv: This is the threshold of variation before a debounce count has begun.
Loops_Debounce: This is the amount of reads in a row before any change is made.
Trip_Debounce: This is the amount of reads above the interlock threshold in a row before regulation trips off.
