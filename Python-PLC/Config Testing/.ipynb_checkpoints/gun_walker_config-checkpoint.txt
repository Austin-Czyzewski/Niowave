Parameter descriptions:
Current Tunnel: The name of the tunnel (West, Test, East)
PLC IP: The IP address of the PLC controlling the magnets. Can be found in productivity suite at the bottom of the screen.
Threshold_Percent: This is the amount of initial collection (in percent) that we are willing to have before we turn this down. Setting this to 0 means
                    that the dog leg will run the full sweep without regard to how much collection remains at each step.
Read_Steps: This is the amount of steps that will be taken throughout the sweep. Higher number is a higher resolution. Be careful with too low of numbers,
               as this will change the window frames very quickly. Too high of numbers just slow the program down. Standard is 40 (11/20/2020)
Center: This is a True or a False. If True then at the end of the dog leg the window frames for both horizontal and vertical will be set to the center of the FWHM
           for those axes. When False, the window frame values will return to their starting value.
count: The number of PLC scans to average the collected current over. This is for CW operation
pulsing_count: Similar to count but for pulsing mode. Likely need more than CW to account for averaging on off pulses.
