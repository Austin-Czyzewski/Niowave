Parameter descriptions:
Current Tunnel: The name of the tunnel (West, Test, East)
PLC IP: The IP address of the PLC controlling the magnets. Can be found in productivity suite at the bottom of the screen.
Threshold_Percent: This is the change between the max value and zero between counting a step taken upwards. This is used solely for calculating the mm's
                    through the aperture.
Runs: How many times you want the Dipole scan to run. This is typically 1 but if you are studying the change in the scan over time you may want more runs.
Step_size: The difference, in Amps, of each step taken on the dipole scan. Highest resolution is currently (11/20/2020) 1mA or .001 Amps. Be careful lowering
            this resolution. It may cause the dipole to take steps faster than anticipated. .001 is the recommended step size
count: The number of PLC scans to average the collected current over. This is for CW operation
pulsing_count: Similar to count but for pulsing mode. Likely need more than CW to account for averaging on 0s. On short duties please see oscilloscope scans.
