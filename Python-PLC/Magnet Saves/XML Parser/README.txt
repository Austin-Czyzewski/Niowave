This file takes the output XML file for magnet saves on the East Tunnel and
	converts them to a more readable/usable .xlsx file.

To use this, simply place this program in a folder with some xml files, and
	run it. The program will prompt you to select the xml file that you
	want to convert. You have two choices when prompted:

	-Choice one: type in the corresponding number to the file you want
		to view. (Found to the left of the file name in the command
		prompt).

	-Choice two: type in the entire name of the xml file that you want
		to view. This should include the .xml file extension.

Once your choice is recorded, the program will create an excel file of the
	same name as the host file with the extension .xlsx. The .xlsx
	file will be grouped by magnet number and sorted in ascending 
	order.

Editing this can be a little bit tricky. To adjust formatting, that all
	takes place in the last nested loop. Any questions, comments,
	or concerns can be brought to the attention of Austin. If there
	is no Austin AND you have questions, comments, or concerns, 
	throw this program away and forget that it exists.
