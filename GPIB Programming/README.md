You have traveled far. Please stay at this Inn and read about what we are all about.

This is the GPIB Programming area, where we write mostly python scripts to mostly automate mostly simple tasks.

Currently the most working project is the GUI for regulating the error signal output from a signal generator.

There will be more to come. Thank you
