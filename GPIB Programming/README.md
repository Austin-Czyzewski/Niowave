You have traveled far. Please stay at this Inn and read about what we are all about.

This is the GPIB Programming area, where we write mostly python scripts to mostly automate mostly simple tasks.

Currently, there a few folders here with names that represent scientific equipment. What is contained within them is
  python scripts testing functions, communications, and overall interactions with them. The most successful of which is the
  O-scope file which contains the ingredients for the Error Signal regulation loop between the signal generator and oscilloscope.

There will be more to come. Thank you for visiting the GPIBinn
