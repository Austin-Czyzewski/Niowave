You have traveled far. Please stay at this Inn and read about what we are all about.

This is the GPIB Programming area, where we write mostly python scripts to mostly automate mostly simple tasks.

Currently, there a few folders here with names that represent scientific equipment. What is contained within them is
  python scripts testing functions, communications, and overall interactions with them. The most successful of which is the
  GUI-python folder which contains the culminations of the work for error signal regulation. This is a large bright GUI that
  contains four buttons that are clearly labeled (Except reset oscilloscope, which instead of resetting the oscilloscope only
  resets the options for it).

There will be more to come. Thank you for visiting the GPIBinn
