This program is an oldtimer, and has been phased out by direct indusoft magnet saves and loads.

These programs are used in order to save magnet settings in our accelerator in the event that the operators would like to look back at old settings, or there is an event that wipes the settings.

They run by using our modbus address for each variable in our automation direct PLCs. They then take that value and convert it from the binary package. From there, they push into an Excel File.
