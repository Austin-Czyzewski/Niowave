To whom it may concern,

I have created this repository to hold my current projects that are being completed at Niowave Inc. 

There are currently four folders in this repository: GPIB Programming, Java-SCADA, Python-PLC, and Scripts. The descriptions to follow.

GPIB Programming: This folder contains the projects that involve SCPI communications through python and the National instruments VISA 
  driver. Currently there is a project that regulates the error signal output a signal generator has into an oscilloscope. Further
  testing and projects are also contained here.
  
Java-SCADA: Being a novice, this folder will contain beginner's projects that are being done here. This will hopefully contain the 
  beginnings of using Java to homebrew a SCADA
 
Python-PLC: This is the most developed of the repositories thus far. This contains many executables to help automate more time consuming
  tasks done here. This contains magnet controls of our systems and data taking scripts. Some of these projects have been phased out as
  they often start off as proof-of-concept and are designed to be simple enough to run entirely through a PLC if need be.
  
Scripts: These are primarily python scripts that I have discontinued work on for one reason or another.

Enjoy.

Warm regards,

Austin Czyzewski
