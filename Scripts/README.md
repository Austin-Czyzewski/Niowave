You have entered the forbidden land! GET OUT (or don't, you can stay and look at my work. Really, I don't mind. 
Actually, the more that I think about it, please stay, I get lonely and could really use the company. I worked pretty hard on 
these and they were immediately thrown out. They may be useful for the future of this programming project and for implementing 
AI to tune/run/do something with our accelerators but... This is a dream... one too large for now... so they have been "tabled" (AKA kicked to the curb and noted to be laughed at if brought up again.).)


These scripts are not commented out. They do work, but have found themselves in the forbidden land.

Since they work, and are not commented, I trust you to do the right thing. You can learn about what they're doing by looking in
the Master file and reading up on some of my other work. If you still don't know. At the time I am writing this the scripts 
are almost solely for the use of gathering BIG DATA, not the song, the data.

Be careful with these, they're sensitive ever since the incident.

Warm and careful regards,

Their Father,

Austin Czyzewski
