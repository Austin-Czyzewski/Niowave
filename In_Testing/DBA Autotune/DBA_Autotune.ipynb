    "# DBA Autotune\n",
    "#### Method\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Kevin Xu's beam tracking software, we can tune in the DBA automatically according to the rules set forth for the DBA tuning process to ensure a focused and tight beam by the time we reach the cavity. Some of the benefits here will be on the fly tuning so that we can check the DBA setup. We could also do this at different emissions so that we have different conditions in which we are tuning on. This file will be an executable so that it will not run in the background.\n",
    "\n",
    "Method to follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - This is going to be tough but hear me out.\n",
    "    - We will require the beam to be on the aperture. Then we are going to loop through to check the following conditions\n",
    "    - When toggling solenoid two, the beam does not move, the beam should simply rotate slightly, there is something to be said of the rotation but what that is I am not sure.\n",
