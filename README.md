Hello Traveler,

You have come far and I can see that you are tired. Let me offer you some assistance.

In this directory you will find the following items as of 01/06/2020 (that's in mm/dd/yyyy):

A file labeled Master, this is a python file and acts as a library for other programs
	listed in the files below. In this file you will find the functions called in other
	programs. If you would like to add to this folder, please note that nothing will
	be harmed by adding a new function, only by editing or deleting the other ones. 
	It is important to note that since this file gets uploaded into other programs, 
	it is imparitive to have a good idea of exactly how many versions are using each function,
	and that if you really need to change one of these, consider the change to the functionality,
	look at the other programs and test them, or just make a new function.
	The purpose of these functions is to make further programming more comprehensible and easier to write.
	
	
A folder titled: Dipole Test
	This folder is for taking Dipole 1 and scanning it to a new value and collecting
	the current collected while doing so. The intended use here is to scan across
	the aperture and measure the current collected on the DBA dump while doing so. 
	
A folder titled: Dog Leg
	This folder is intended to automate dog legs. The current state of these is to replicate
	how a human would perform a dog leg. Future plans may take a shape that could be more useful
	than the scanning method currently used.
	
A folder titled: Magnet Saves
	This folder holds a dear place in my heart, and this is where this whole project began. This 
	started with an impromptu way to save magnet settings for a quick fix and the potential grew.
	Hopefully, months down the road, this folder gets hard to find because it is surrounded by so
	many great programs to make beamwork more precise.
	
A folder titled: Magnet Ramping
	This folder contains a project that stood in only for a few weeks. This was a temporary fix
	for a problem that operators faced with new updates to the GUI or Logic of the PLC's where 
	all of our magnets would be turned off and it would waste time to ramp them up. This was created 
	to load in a magnet save and ramp the magnets to the new values, it still took some time but saved
	many man-hours.
	
A folder titled: Scripts
	This is a folder of scripts that were tested but never quite found a use, there are files in here that
	may be useful in the future, for automated tuning of the beamline. But that project is quite a bit down 
	the line, so here are the scripts in all their glory. 
	
	
A word document titled: future projects
	This document contains ramblings and ideas about future ideas with python as a modbus communicator.
